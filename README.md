# Variational Quantum Eigensolver - QOSF 2020
Hey! This is Rohit Pai. This is my solution to **task 4** - Finding the lowest eigenvalue of the given matrix using VQE like circuits - for the QOSF Quantum Computing Mentorship Program.

The jupyter notebook named VQE_single_qubit.ipynb is a file where I practised implementing VQE on single qubit systems.
The jupyter notebook named VQE_submission.ipynb is my solution to the task 4 and contains relevant explanation and documentation along with the code. 

To view the repository locally, you can clone the repository using the following command in a local directory or download a zip of the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Rohit23110/Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver/

To run the code, the requirements need to be installed in an virtual environment (recommended) or globally by opening the local copy of the repository in the terminal and running
    
    pip install -U -r requirements.txt 
    
or executing the first cell in VQE_submission.ipynb. It is assumed that the user has python and pip installed on the local machine.

If there is any difficulty in viewing or running the code, you can view the file named VQE_submission.html or view it on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Rohit23110/Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver/blob/master/VQE_submission.ipynb).
