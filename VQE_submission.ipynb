Since we cannot directly measure in an arbitrary basis, transformations have to be performed on the trial state to convert it into Z basis (i.e. the $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\ and\\ |1\\rangle$ basis).

    "\n",
    "1. In case of Ansatz1, Ansatz2, Ansatz3 and Ansatz4, the expectation values that are obtained are 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> orders of magnitude away from the lowest eigenvalue. Hence, they are not good ansatze. The reason behind this is that the all these ansatz are neither expressible nor represent a large number of states. So, even after optimization the circuit would not give an eigen value of -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Entanglement was introduced in all circuits from Ansatz5, which increases the expressibility of the ansatz\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In case of Ansatz 5, the number of gates have been increased and entanglement has been introduced. So, the circuit is expressible. But, the subspace represented by the ansatz still does not contain the exact state represented by the required eigen vector. Hence, we are still an order of magnitude away from the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In case of Ansatz 6, the number of gates have been further increased but this worsens the expectation value. This might be due the fact that we have only 2 parameters and adding more gates makes the task of the optimiser difficult without giving a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In case of Ansatz 7, we add more parameters to the circuit while keeping the number of gates constant. This increases the expressibility further and now we get a much better upper bound. The drawback is that the circuit takes longer to execute and more time is taken per iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In case of Ansatz 8, we increase the gates again but this time we have 4 parameters instead of 2. This is the best I could do with my circuit and was the closest expectation value I got. The drawback here was same as Ansatz 7 and I had to look for alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. I had a look at the ansatz given in the hint and applied it here. It had only 3 gates and 1 parameter so I was suspicious. But surprisingly, it gave the exact eigenvalue of -1 each time I executed it without taking long to execute. Later, I deduced that the subspace represented by AnsatzHint contains the exact eigenvector that we need and varying the parameter would always lead us to the exact solution. Since, the circuit is small, it is not expressible but it works in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analysing all these observations, one can see that we can get a good (or exact) upper bound on the lowest eigen value if we know the subspace in which the corresponding eigenvector lies. We can design very shallow circuits which sweep that subspace to get the eigenvalue. This approach cannot be generalised as in large and random hamiltonians we would not know the subspace in which the eigenvectors lie and we need expressible circuits. In such cases, we need generalised circuits like Ansatz8 which would take more time but give us a good upper bound."

The main outcomes for me were that choosing an ansatz for such circuits is an art and it would take a lot of time to develop an intuition in it. I also learnt that there are several factors that can affect the outcome of a variational circuit such as cost of the circuit, expressibility of the circuit, number of parameters, noise of the device, etc. and striking the right balance is important to get a good result.
