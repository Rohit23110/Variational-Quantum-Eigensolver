    "## Introduction\n",
    "Variational Quantum Eigensolver is an algorithm that helps us find an upper bound on the lowest eigen value of a given Hamiltonian. This notebook will not go into much depth on the theoretical aspects of the algorithm such as the variational principle and what a Hamiltonian. This article<sup>[[1]]</sup> by Michał Stęchły and original paper on VQE<sup>[[2]]</sup> do a great job of explaining them. Here, The focus will be on the implementation of the algorithm.  \n",

    "1. Design a parameterized circuit (ansatz) for trial state preparation. Design the quantum modules based on the tensor products of Pauli matrices obtained by decomposing the Hamiltonian.  \n",

Sp, to get an approximate idea of what the trial state would have been, the same circuit is repeatedly prepared and measurements are performed measurements to get the counts of each output state.

The reason being that to calculate the expectation value for $\\sigma_{X}$ and $\\sigma_{y}$, measurements have to be performed and counts have to be obtained in the X and Y basis respectively. Since we cannot directly measure in an arbitrary basis, transformations have to be performed on the trial state to convert it into Z basis (i.e. the $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\ and\\ |1\\rangle$ basis). For $\\sigma_{X}$, a Hadamard (or $H$) gate is applied and for $\\sigma_{y}$, $S^{\\dagger}$ followed by $H$ gate are applied for the transformation.\n",

    "For a 2-qubit system, the expectation value for tensor products has to be calculated.

    "The quantum modules give us a set of counts for each basis state i.e.$\\ \\left| 00 \\right\\rangle,\\ \\left| 01 \\right\\rangle,$$\\ \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle\\ and\\ |11\\rangle$. The probability of each state is calculated by dividing the count of each state by the total number of counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation value is the sum of product of probabilities of each state and their associated eigen value. As we know, the eigen value of state $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle,\\left| + \\right\\rangle$, and $\\left| i \\right\\rangle$ is $+ 1$ and of state $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle,\\left| - \\right\\rangle$, and $\\left| - i \\right\\rangle$ is $- 1$. The eigen value of tensor products of these states would then be a product of their individual eigen values. Since every state has been transformed into the Z basis, the eigenvalues of only 4 states need to tbe considered. It comes out to be $+ 1$ for $|00\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle$ and $- 1\\ $for $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$.\n",

    "The formula used for the calculation depends on the Pauli product used but can be generalised to three cases:\n",

    "The expectation value in these cases depends only on the second qubit as the first Pauli matrix is $I$. There is no need to create a totally new circuit in these cases and the probabilities obtained from the quantum modules can be used. The eigenvalue of the state is considered as the eigenvalue of state of qubit 2 i.e. states having 1 on the second qubit have $- 1$ and for the states having on the first qubit have $+ 1$. Hence, the expectation value for this case is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\langle \\sigma_{I} \\otimes \\sigma_{i} \\right\\rangle\\  = P_{00}\\left( + 1 \\right) + P_{01}\\left( - 1 \\right) + P_{10}\\left( + 1 \\right) + P_{11}( - 1)\\ where\\ i = X,\\ Y\\ and\\ Z\\ $$\n",

    "As it is seen above, the VQE algorithm is able to return the exact lowest eigenvalue for the given Hamiltonian for the selected ansatz (the classical method may give a small error which can be neglected). While writing the code, it was observed that varying the ansatz gives varying degrees of success and choosing the correct ansatz for a problem is an art. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the above measurements are done on a noiseless simulator so the output that VQE gives is very close to the exact eigenvalue, provided the correct ansatz is chosen. Executing the same code on a noisy IBM quantum computer led to errors of the magnitude 10<sup>-1</sup>, which is quite far from the exact eigen value. The circuit can be transpiled and optimised to perform better on real hardware and react better to noise."
